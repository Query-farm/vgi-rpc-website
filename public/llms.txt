## Key Concepts

VGI-RPC uses Apache Arrow IPC as its serialization format, giving callers zero-copy access to columnar data without schema negotiation or code generation. Clients create typed proxy objects that mirror the server's service interface; method calls are dispatched over a pluggable transport layer.

**Transports:** pipe, subprocess, Unix socket, shared memory, HTTP, and worker pool. Each transport implements the same framing protocol so services are portable across deployment topologies.

**RPC Patterns:** unary (single request/response), unary void (fire-and-forget), producer (server-streaming with optional header), and exchange (bidirectional streaming with optional header).

**Arrow IPC Serialization:** Arguments and return values are encoded as Arrow record batches. Complex types, optional types, and dataclass/struct types are mapped automatically from each language's native type system.

**Typed Proxies:** Client code calls methods on a proxy object that mirrors the server interface. The proxy handles serialization, transport framing, and deserialization transparently.
